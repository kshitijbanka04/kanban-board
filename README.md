## Requirements
1. Clone the repository
2. run the command '''npm -i''' under both express-backend and react-frontend
3. Open 2 new terminals one pointing at the react-frontend directory and other to the express-backend one.
4. Once we are in the directory, run npm run dev(for conitunous testing)
5. Click on the localhost link given by frontend terminal.

## Thoughts while making search
1. For searching we used Debouncing to reduce API calls
